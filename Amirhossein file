Back end desinger and programmer for fridger application


> 15-07-2022

> I have implement the logic part of the program using java. i have made the different objects item/recipe/allrecipes(as our database)/user/icon/allicons/
measure/shoppingList/recipes/Type/Quantity/Fridge/Fridger and used different logics to get the certain functionalities each time.
In the main program Fridger the object of other types are being created and used according to the needs of user.
for example i have different functions to find the needed recipes/ finding unavailable recipes / removing the item from the fridge if the item's expiration
date is due and etc



Also i have implemented the control part by using the logic and implementing it to the GUI part. The control is the part which the user interface uses the
logic from back end to get specific information.
